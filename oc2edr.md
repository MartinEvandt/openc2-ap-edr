#### Abstract:
Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. Endpoint detection and response technologies provide a means for continuous monitoring and analysis to more readily identify, detect, and prevent advanced threats. This OpenC2 Actuator Profile defines the Actions, Targets, Specifiers and Options that are consistent with the Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification ([OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]) in the context of command and control of various endpoint detection and response technologies.

# 1 Introduction

<!-- All text is normative unless otherwise labeled -->


Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named ap-edr-v1.0-wd01.md):

pandoc -f gfm -t html ap-edr-v1.0-wd01.md -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css --toc --toc-depth=5 -s -o ap-edr-v1.0-wd01.html --metadata title="OpenC2 Actuator Profile for Endpoint Detection and Response Version 1.0"

OASIS staff are currently using pandoc 2.6 from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.6.

This also requires the presence of a .css file containing the HTML styles (like styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css).

Note this command generates a Table of Contents (TOC) in HTML which is located at the top of the HTML document, and which requires additional editing in order to be published in the expected OASIS style. This editing will be handled by OASIS staff during publication.
A TC may use other ways to generate HTML from markdown, which may generate a TOC in a different way.

## 1.1 Changes from earlier versions


## 1.2 Glossary

### 1.2.1 Definitions of terms
Sensor: A data capturing utility within the context of an EDR.

### 1.2.2 Acronyms and abbreviations
EDR: Endpoint Detection and Response

ED: Endpoint Detection

ER: Endpoint Response

## 1.3 Purpose and Scope

An 'Endpoint Detection and Response' (EDR) system is a security mechanism which identifies malicious behaviours by recording system activities and comparing them to sets of signatures or heuristics. EDR systems facilitate in digital forensics and incident response by storing and indexing said events, as well as provide functionality to respond to security incidents as they pertain to actively exploited, infected or vulnerable endpoints.

This Actuator profile specifies the set of Actions, Targets, Specifiers, and Command Arguments that integrates EDR functionality with the Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Command set. Through this Command set, cyber security orchestrators may gain visibility into and provide control over the EDR functionality in a manner that is independent of the instance of the EDR function.

All components, devices and systems that provide EDR functionality will implement the OpenC2 Actions, Targets, Specifiers and Arguments identified as required in this document. Actions that are applicable, but not necessarily required, for EDR will be identified as optional.

The purpose of this document is to:

* Identify the required and optional OpenC2 Actions for Actuators with EDR functionality
* Identify the required and optional Target types for each Action in the EDR class of Actuators
* Identify Actuator-Specifiers and Arguments for each Action/Target pair that are applicable and/or unique to the EDR class of Actuators
* Annotate each Action/Target pair with a justification and example, and provide sample OpenC2 Commands to a EDR with corresponding Responses

This EDR profile:

* Does not define or implement Actions beyond those defined in Version 1.0 of the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10)
* Is consistent with Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification

Cyber defense systems that are utilizing OpenC2 may require the following components to implement the EDR profile:

* OpenC2 Producers: Devices that send Commands, receive Responses, and manage the execution of Commands involving one or more EDR or other Actuators with EDR capability. The OpenC2 Producer needs _a prior_ knowledge of which Commands the Actuator can process and execute, therefore must understand the profiles for any device that it intends to command
* OpenC2 Consumers: Devices or instances that provide endpoint detection and response functions. Typically these are Actuators that execute the cyber defense function, but could be orchestrators (i.e., a device or instance that forwards Commands to the Actuator)

# 2 OpenC2 Language Binding for Endpoint Response

_This section is normative_

This section defines the set of Actions, Targets, Specifiers, and Arguments that are meaningful in the context of Endpoint Response (ER). This section also describes the appropriate format for the status and properties of a Response frame. This section is organized into three major subsections; Command Components, Response Components and Commands.

Extensions to the Language Specification are defined in accordance with [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10), Section 3.1.5, where:

1. The unique name of the EDR schema is `oasis-open.org/openc2/v1.0/ap-edr`
2. The namespace identifier (nsid) referring to the EDR schema is:  `edr`
3. The definitions of and conformance requirements for these types are contained in this document

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command Components
The components of an OpenC2 Command include Actions, Targets, Actuators and associated Arguments and Specifiers. Appropriate aggregation of the components will define a Command-body that is meaningful in the context of an EDR.

This specification identifies the applicable components of an OpenC2 Command. The components of an OpenC2 Command include:

* Action:  A subset of the Actions defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of an EDR.
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions that are external to Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10)
    * This profile MAY augment the definition of the Actions in the context of an EDR
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions in a manner that is inconsistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification
* Target:  A subset of the Targets and Target-Specifiers defined in Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of EDR and one Target (and its associated Specifier) that is defined in this specification
* Arguments:  A subset of the Arguments defined in the Language Specification and a set of Arguments defined in this specification
* Actuator:  A set of specifiers defined in this specification that are meaningful in the context of EDR

### 2.1.1 Actions
Table 2.1.1-1 presents the OpenC2 Actions defined in version 1.0 of the Language Specification which are meaningful in the context of an ER Actuator. The particular Action/Target pairs that are required or are optional are presented in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands).

**Table 2.1.1-1. Actions Applicable to ER**

**_Type: Action (Enumerated)_**

| ID | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 7 | **contain** | Isolate a device from communicating with other devices on a network. |
| 8 | **allow** | Un-isolate a previously isolated device. |
| 9 | **start** | Initiate a process, application, system, or activity. |
| 10 | **stop** | Halt a system or end an activity. |
| 11 | **restart** | Restart a device, system, or process. |
| 16 | **update** | Instructs the Actuator to retrieve, install, process, and operate in accordance with a software update, reconfiguration, or other update. |
| 19 | **create** | Add a new entity of a known type. (E.g., registry entry, file) |
| 20 | **delete** | Remove an entity (E.g., registry entry, file) |



### 2.1.2 Targets
Table 2.1.2-1 summarizes the Targets defined in Version 1.0 of the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10) as they relate to EDR functionality. Table 2.1.2-2 summarizes the Targets that are defined in this specification.

#### 2.1.2.1 Common Targets
Table 2.1.2-1 lists the Targets defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification that are applicable to EDR . The particular Action/Target pairs that are required or are optional are presented in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands).

**Table 2.1.2-1. Targets Applicable to ER**

**_Type: Target (Choice)_**

| ID | Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 | **device** | Device | The properties of a device |
| 9 | **features** | Features | A set of items such as Action/Target pairs, profiles versions, options that are supported by the Actuator. The Target is used with the query Action to determine an Actuator's capabilities |
| 10 | **file** | File | The properties of a file|
| 18 | **process** | Process | Common properties of an instance of a computer program as executed on an operating system |

#### 2.1.2.2 ER Targets
The list of common Targets is extended to include the additional Targets defined in this section and referenced with the edr namespace.

#### 2.1.3.1.1 Registry Entry

**_Type: Registry Entry (Record{1..*})_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | **path** | String | 1 | The absolute path of the registry entry including the hive and optionally the key. If the key is not included then the key property MUST be populated.|
| 2 | **key** | String | 0\.\.1 | The registry key. They key may contain subkeys referenced with a backslash to indicate hierarchy. |
| 3 | **type** | String | 1 | The registry value type as defined in the Microsoft Windows [[Winnt.h header]](#winnth-registry-types) |
| 4 | **value** | String | 0\.\.1 | The value of the registry key. The actuator is responsible to format the value in accordance with the defined type. |

### 2.1.4 Command Arguments
Arguments provide additional precision to a Command by including information such as how, when, or where a Command is to be executed. Table 2.1.3-1 summarizes the Command Arguments defined in Version 1.0 of the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10) as they relate to ER functionality.

## 2.2 OpenC2 Response Components
Response messages originate from the Actuator as a result of a Command.

Responses associated with required Actions MUST be implemented. Implementations that include optional Actions MUST implement the RESPONSE associated with the implemented Action. Additional details regarding the Command and associated Response are captured in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands). Examples are provided in [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-commands).

### 2.2.1 Common Results
Table 2.2.1-1 lists the Response Results properties defined in the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10) that are applicable to EDR.

### 2.2.3 Response Status Codes
Table 2.2.1-2 lists the Response Status Codes defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification that are applicable to EDR.

**Table 2.2.1-2. Response Status Codes**

**_Type: Status-Code (Enumerated.ID)_**

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 102 | Processing. Command received but action not necessarily complete. |
| 200 | OK. |
| 400 | Bad Request. Unable to process Command, parsing error. |
| 500 | Internal Error. |

## 2.3 OpenC2 Commands

An OpenC2 Command consists of an Action/Target pair and associated Specifiers and Arguments. This section enumerates the allowed Commands and presents the associated Responses.

Table 2.3-1 defines the Commands that are valid in the context of the ER profile. An Action (the top row in Table 2.3-1) paired with a Target (the first column in Table 2.3-1) defines a valid Command. The subsequent subsections provide the property tables applicable to each OpenC2 Command.

**Table 2.3-1. Command Matrix**

# 3 Conformance
(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).
